## Code and Documentation for To2 Fishery Data ##

*Background:* We are pulling together fishery dependent data for the 2022 research track assessment of black sea bass. Our hope is that the code and documentation associated with this project will be useful for future assessments, and that presenting the information in a cohesive repo format will allow for the easy modification for future use. Because these are expansive and complex data sets we suggest those interested in modifying the contents do so with caution and in collaboration with the original authors. Much of this work is in development and constructive suggestions are very welcome.
